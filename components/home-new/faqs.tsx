    //         answer: 'At WebWunder, we’re entrepreneurs like you, so we understand the challenges you face. Our custom, template-free websites are designed to drive sales, reduce costs, and save you time. With continuous AI optimizations and hassle-free updates, you’ll never need another agency.

    //         question:
    //             'Why is your website model subscription-based? Why not a one-time payment?',
    //         answer: 'A one-time project doesn’t cut it for long-term success. As entrepreneurs, we know your business needs ongoing support. That’s why we offer a subscription model, ensuring your website continues to perform exceptionally well over time, with regular updates and optimizations that keep you ahead.',

    //         question:
    //             'What is the Unlimited Design Plan, and why did you introduce it?',
    //         answer: 'Our Unlimited Design Plan was created for entrepreneurs who need constant, high-quality design work without the hassle of ongoing negotiations. This plan offers unlimited design requests, fast delivery, and full design ownership—all for a flat monthly fee.

    //         question: 'How fast will I receive my website?',
    //         answer: 'Your website will typically be live within 4 to 6 weeks, depending on its complexity. Your total time commitment? Less than an hour.',

    //     {
    //         question: 'What happens if I want to stop my subscription?',
    //         answer: 'If you cancel, your website will go offline since it’s leased through us. However, you can take full ownership by paying an exit fee of €3,000, €6,000, or €9,000 depending on your plan. This gives you full control, but ongoing updates and support won’t be available.',

Built by entrepreneurs for entrepreneurs, your WebWunder site is designed to perform better in every way—including search rankings. As your business grows, so will your online visibility.
